<div id="installation"></div>

## Installation

1. **Download the mirlo jar file for your platform**. You can find the latest version on [our releases page](https://github.com/myth-MC/mirlo/releases).
2. **Add the mirlo jar file to your server's plugin folder**. Make sure to delete any older versions of mirlo.
3. **Fully restart your server**. Type `/stop` and start the server again [instead of using `/reload`](https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/problem-with-reload/).

Repeat the steps for every backend of your network.

<div id="usage"></div>

## Usage

Once you run mirlo for the first time it will generate a `config.yml` file under `/plugins/mirlo`. This file contains everything you might want to modify depending on your needs.

### Events

Events listen for specific actions that happen in the game. Right now you can use:
* **PLAYER_KILLS_PLAYER_EVENT** (player, targetPlayer): triggered whenever a player kills another player.
* **PLAYER_KILLS_CREATURE_EVENT** (player): triggered whenever a player kills a mob.
* **PLAYER_DEATH_EVENT** (targetPlayer): triggered whenever a player dies.

### Variables

Variables are temporary fields which can be altered when an event is triggered. Valid types are:
* **count**: a whole number. Can be positive or negative.
* **boolean**: true/false.

### Channels

Channels are the mean of communication where information will be exchanged with other backend servers or the proxy.

#### Placeholders

You can use placeholders when sending or receiving a plugin message from a specific channel. Valid placeholders are:
* Pre-defined variables.
* `player`
* `targetPlayer`

### Example _config.yml_ with hints

```yaml
variables:
  streak: # Variable "streak"
    type: count # Can be count or boolean
    scope: player # This variable will be unique for every player. Change to "global" if you want it to be the same for every player
    default: 0 # The default value whenever "streak" is resetted
    increase: # When should "streak" increase
      - PLAYER_KILLS_PLAYER_EVENT # A player kills another player
    decrease: [] # When should "streak" decrease. (never in this case)
    reset: # When should "streak" return to its default value
      - PLAYER_DEATH_EVENT # A player dies

channels:
  players: # Channel "mirlo:players"
    target: proxy # Where should messages from this channels be sent (survival, skywars, etc) (set to all if message should be sent to every backend)
    send: # What events should be sent
      - PLAYER_KILLS_PLAYER_EVENT,streak
      - PLAYER_DEATH_EVENT
    receive: [] # Won't do anything for now
```
