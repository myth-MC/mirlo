## üìö Information

**mirlo üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ** provides server owners with a simple way of implementing and handling plugin messaging between a proxy and its backends (check [Usage](#usage)).

>[!WARNING]
> mirlo is **not ready for production use** yet. The project is still missing an important part of its core functions (right now its sole purpose is sending plugin messages to a proxy). You can report any misbehaviours or share any feedback by [creating an issue](https://github.com/myth-MC/mirlo/issues).

<div id="installation"></div>

## üì• Installation

1. **Download the mirlo jar file for your platform**. You can find the latest version on [our releases page](https://github.com/myth-MC/mirlo/releases).
2. **Add the mirlo jar file to your server's plugin folder**. Make sure to delete any older versions of mirlo.
3. **Fully restart your server**. Type `/stop` and start the server again [instead of using `/reload`](https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/problem-with-reload/).

Repeat the steps for every backend of your network.

<div id="usage"></div>

## üñäÔ∏è Usage

When you run mirlo for the very first time it will automatically generate three different configurable files that can be adjusted depending on your server's needs:
* `settings.yml` contains general settings
* `channels.yml` contains every channel to listen for
* `variables.yml` contains every variable

Every file has one or more examples with hints.

### Events

Events listen for specific actions that happen in the game. Right now you can use:
* **PLAYER_KILLS_PLAYER_EVENT** (player, targetPlayer): triggered whenever a player kills another player.
* **PLAYER_KILLS_CREATURE_EVENT** (player): triggered whenever a player kills a mob.
* **PLAYER_DEATH_EVENT** (targetPlayer): triggered whenever a player dies.

_Values in parentheses are placeholders._

### Variables

Variables are temporary fields which can be altered when an event is triggered. Valid types are:
* **count**: a whole number. Can be positive or negative.
* **boolean**: true/false.

### Channels

Channels are the mean of communication where information will be exchanged with other backend servers or the proxy.

#### Placeholders

You can use placeholders when sending or receiving a plugin message from a specific channel. Valid placeholders are:
* Pre-defined variables (variables.yml)
* `player`
* `targetPlayer`
